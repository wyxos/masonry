# `main.js` Documentation

## File Purpose

The `main.js` file is the entry point of the Vue.js application. It's responsible for creating and mounting the main Vue instance (App) to the HTML.

## Key Functions

- `createApp(App)`: This function from Vue.js is used to create a new instance of the Vue application using the `App.vue` component.

- `mount('#app')`: This method is used to mount the created Vue instance to a DOM element. In this case, the Vue instance is being attached to the HTML element with the id 'app'.

## How It's Used

When the application is started, `main.js` is the first file that gets executed. It initializes the Vue application by creating an instance of `App.vue` and attaches it to the DOM. This triggers the Vue lifecycle and the application starts running.

## Dependencies

- `vue`: This is the core Vue.js library. It's used to create and control the Vue application.
- `wyxos-masonry.css`: This is a CSS file, presumably containing styles for a masonry layout. It's imported to be used across the Vue application.
- `App.vue`: This is the root Vue component that contains the whole application. It's imported and used to create the main Vue instance.

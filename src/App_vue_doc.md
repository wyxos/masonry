================

### File Purpose

This file contributes to the project by providing a functional and interactive masonry layout component, `WyxosMasonry`, which can be used to display items with random positioning. The component also includes features for adding new items, loading more items, and removing existing items.

### Key Functions/Classes

*   **`loadNext`**, **`loadPrevious`**, and **`load`**: These functions simulate the loading of new or previous pages in the masonry layout.
*   **`handleUpdatePages`**: This function updates the `pages` ref with new page data.
*   **`onAdd`**: This function adds random items to each page in the masonry layout.

### How It's Used

This file is typically used as the main entry point for the application, where the `WyxosMasonry` component is rendered. The component can be controlled using the `load`, `loadNext`, and `loadPrevious` functions, which are bound to user interactions such as button clicks.

### Dependencies

*   **`vue`**: The Vue.js framework used for building the application.
*   **`uuid`**: A library used for generating unique IDs for items in the masonry layout.
*   **`wyxos-masonry`**: A custom component (not shown here) that provides a basic implementation of a masonry layout.

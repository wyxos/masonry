# App.vue

## File Purpose
`App.vue` is the main component file in a Vue application. This file is responsible for loading and managing a list of items in a masonry layout using the `WyxosMasonry` component. It provides functionality to load initial items, load next and previous pages of items, and add new items at random positions.

## Key Functions/Classes

- `loadNext`: This function is responsible for loading the next page of items. It simulates a delay to show a loading state.
- `loadPrevious`: This function is responsible for loading the previous page of items, if it exists. It also simulates a delay to show a loading state.
- `load`: This function is responsible for loading the initial set of items. It also simulates a delay to show a loading state.
- `handleUpdatePages`: This function updates the `pages` value with the updated pages.
- `onAdd`: This function adds a new item at a random position in each page.

## How It's Used
`App.vue` is typically the entry point of a Vue application. It renders the `WyxosMasonry` component and manages the state of the items displayed within it. The `load`, `loadNext`, and `loadPrevious` functions are passed as props to the `WyxosMasonry` component and are used to fetch the items to be displayed.

## Dependencies

- `WyxosMasonry`: A custom Vue component imported from `./components/WyxosMasonry.vue`.
- `uuid`: A library used to generate unique identifiers for each item.
- `vue`: The Vue library, from which `computed`, `onMounted`, and `ref` are imported.
